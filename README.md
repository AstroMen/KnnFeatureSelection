## KnnFeatureSelection

This project contains an implementation of feature selection algorithms, specifically Forward Selection and Backward Elimination, which can be used to select optimal subsets of features from a larger set. The selection is based on the accuracy of a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier. The scripts also include functionality to visualize the feature selection process. Users can load their own datasets, select the feature selection method they want to use, and visualize the results.
